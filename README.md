3. Second most transcation of Zomato is from United States, where the service is available in 35 cities.


4. Third most transaction of Zomato is from United Kingdom, but their service is availble only in 4 cities in Uk. However, the number of transaction in India is very high compared to US and Uk and the number are not any close. This is because Zomato is  a Indian based company and is more popula in India.


5. There are around 46 cities from the above listed 15 countries, that have only one zomato serving restaurant in each city.They belong to Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Phillipines, South Africa and United States. By increasing the number of outlets per city will help increase the transaction in these countries.


6. Least transction of Zomato is from Canada.This may be because zomato provides its service in only 4 cities and each city has only one zomato restaurant. Zomato can start with the cities that they already provide service and increase the number of restaurants in these cities. Later can expand to different cities in Canda for more transactions.


7. From the dataset its clear that Online delivery option did not have impact on good ratings. Excellent, Good and Average rating counts are higher for restaurants who do not provide online delivery service. And count of restaurants rated poor are compartively less in restaurants that do not provide online service. This may be because most of the time Zomato is used to serach for good restaurant to "Dine in" and have given ratings for those restaurants.


8. Table booking option also donot have impact on rating counts. This may be because people prefer walk in and enjoy their food rather booking table in advance.

In Uk providing American, British, Indian, Burger, Chinese, Italian and cafes cuisines will help. 
In canada cuisines like Italian, pizza, Mediteran, chinese, asian and sushi are most preferred.

12. Since popularity of zomato helps in more transcation in India Zomato has to break ground in other markets by advertising and partnering with well established restaurants.
